# Decoding Anime Ratings: Insights from MyAnimeList Data

Why do certain anime receive higher user scores on MyAnimeList (MAL), and what characteristics of anime, as well as user demographic and behavioral aspects, contribute to these ratings? This analysis is crucial for elevating the anime-watching experience and optimizing content offerings for industry stakeholders. Anime, with its diverse genres and a passionate global fanbase, provides a unique opportunity to explore consumer behavior. Investigating the reasons behind higher user ratings offers valuable insights into content characteristics that resonate with viewers, shaping preferences and influencing engagement. For producers and streaming services hosting anime content, understanding these dynamics is critical for strategic content creation and marketing, enhancing audience satisfaction and overall success in a competitive landscape.

This study explores factors influencing higher user scores on MAL, examining anime characteristics, user demographics, and behaviors. It analyzes the impact of anime genre, type, source, episode count, and user gender on average user ratings. Methodologically, it utilizes Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests to identify significant differences, alongside correlation and regression analyses for predictive insights. The project also sets out to explore the intricate dynamics of anime scoring. With access to a mixture of categorical and numerical anime features, this study aims to forecast average user scores. Additionally, it delves into uncovering latent structures and inherent clusters among users, derived from their viewing habits. Methodologically, it utilizes Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression, Gradient Boosted (GB) and Random Forest (RF) Regressor models to project an anime's average score. Furthermore, it leverages Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means clustering to gain insights into the underlying structures and patterns within the user dataset, providing a comprehensive understanding of anime scoring dynamics and user behavior on MAL.
